# Etch-a-sketch - by PabloPG

## An etch-a-sketch project to learn how to add things dinamically

### Created with HTML, CSS & JS

#### What would I add or change in the future?

-Select colours manually
-Click&drag functionallity, not just mouseover to paint stuff.

I've prefered stop working on this project and keep learning the stuff I need, that's why it may feel unfinished.

That's all folks!
